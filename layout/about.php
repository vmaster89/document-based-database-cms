		Hi *, <br /> 
		<br /> 
		my name is Marc and I'm a german based freetime webcoder and Junior IT-Consultant (1 year work experience). I'm 26 years old and did my abitur (~ a-levels in the us or matura in austria and italia) back in 2009 and have had professional-courses in german language and biology. 
		Still computer-related subjects accompanied me mostly since the 8th grade in middle-school-times. Also I have got a deep interest for economics, philosophy and politics, that's the reason why I have decided to study politics from 2011 until the end of 2015. 
		My aim was to become a dataanalyst in social-research*, my B. A.-thesis was done with statistical methods and had the topic "Legitimacy Through Growth: A Comparative Statistical Analysis". 
		To have the best basics for such a job, I decided to improve my IT-knowledge. That is how I got a job as a working-student for process- and webdevelopment in the business-area of digital marketing. 
		I found it interesting enough to not go back to university. That's how I became what I'm now. <br /> 
		Nethertheless I did some computer-science-tests. Also I was interested enough to take a look on business-computer-science aswell. 
		All that is the reason why I was more or less at the uni between the end of '09 to '15.<br /> 
		<br /> 
		Coding and webmedia-creation is a hobby of mine since I was a teenager. Back in the day, before I got interested in empirical-research, I have always thought about becomming a media-designer. 
		That's why I'm still doing this and I'm also still interested in such topics.<br /> 
		<br /> 
		My job-life is mostly about software-requirements, time-estimation, customer-care and of course a bit of coding aswell. 
		Mostly I work with the JavaScript Framework JQuery, HTML5, XML (for webservices), sometimes bootstrap, mostly SQL and I do a lot of datamanagement-work (still I'm just a console-ruler and table-designer, not a full-stack-database-admin. <br /> 
		<br /> 
		Of all the languages I have used yet, mostly I've liked to code webbased or in C#. <br /> 
		<br />
