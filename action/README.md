# document-based-database-cms
Simple CMS with a database based on JSON 

This CMS is just more a concept than a final product. It is still in progress and an early alpha. Of course many coders recommend not to rebuild the wheel, but somehow I was bored some weekends in november and came to the idea that it might be cool to code a leightweight CMS on my own. The CMS is based on a rural MVC-Model. 

Functions: 
- User can create/delete/edit Blog-Entrys 
- User can create/delete/edit Webpages 

Of course he can also log in and out. Also I was starting to create an authentification system based on cookies, but it is not fully implemented yet. 

Some more ideas where: 
1. Image upload 
2. "Load more...."-function based on a mockservice 
3. Commentary function with Captcha 
4. User-Administration 
5. Token-Generation (This is indeed very important for a secure CMS) 

As I have lot of work to do, I have paused this project. Maybe I'm going to restart it all over and refactor everything in the future - I don't know that yet. Basically it is working.
